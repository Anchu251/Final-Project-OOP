# 🎮 Final Project OOP  
A small Python project I built as part of my **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** course.  
It’s a simple **score manager** that saves and loads high scores from a CSV file.  

# 🛠️ Tech
- Python 3.x  
- Built-in libs: `csv`, `os`

# 🚀 Run it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anchu251/Final-Project-OOP.git
cd Final-Project-OOP
python OOPFinalPrj.py
